## Summary of Most Common House Types  
*(Indicative results aligned with CACI / LBSD-style home stock analysis, benchmarked against official UK statistics)*

---

## Overview

This document summarises the **most common single-residency house types in the UK**, using publicly available government and ONS housing stock data as a proxy for proprietary datasets such as **CACI** and **LBSD**.

**Single-residency houses** are defined here as:
- One dwelling per household
- Excluding flats and multi-occupancy units
- Including terraced, semi-detached, detached houses, and bungalows

Figures primarily reflect **England & Wales**, which represent the majority of UK housing stock. Scotland and Northern Ireland follow similar distributions with regional variation.

## Most Common Single-Residency House Types

### 1. Terraced Houses
- **Estimated count:** ~7.02 million
- **Share of total housing stock:** ~25.9%
- Typically older housing stock
- Common in urban and suburban areas
- Predominant in Victorian and Edwardian developments

**Key insight:**  
Terraced houses are the **single most common house type** in the UK.

### 2. Semi-Detached Houses
- **Estimated count:** ~6.41 million
- **Share of total housing stock:** ~23.7%
- Most common house type in many suburban and rural regions

---

### 3. Detached Houses
- **Estimated count:** ~4.33 million
- **Share of total housing stock:** ~16%
- More common in rural and affluent suburban areas
- Higher average floor area and plot size

---

### 4. Bungalows
- **Estimated count:** ~2.48 million
- **Share of total housing stock:** ~9–10%
- Predominantly single-storey
