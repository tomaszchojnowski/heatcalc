# UK Single-Residency Housing Stock  
## Summary of Most Common House Types  
*(Indicative results aligned with CACI / LBSD-style home stock analysis, benchmarked against official UK statistics)*

---

## Overview

This document summarises the **most common single-residency house types in the UK**, using publicly available government and ONS housing stock data as a proxy for proprietary datasets such as **CACI** and **LBSD**.

**Single-residency houses** are defined here as:
- One dwelling per household
- Excluding flats and multi-occupancy units
- Including terraced, semi-detached, detached houses, and bungalows

Figures primarily reflect **England & Wales**, which represent the majority of UK housing stock. Scotland and Northern Ireland follow similar distributions with regional variation.

---

## Most Common Single-Residency House Types

### 1. Terraced Houses
- **Estimated count:** ~7.02 million
- **Share of total housing stock:** ~25.9%
- Typically older housing stock
- Common in urban and suburban areas
- Predominant in Victorian and Edwardian developments

**Key insight:**  
Terraced houses are the **single most common house type** in the UK.

---

### 2. Semi-Detached Houses
- **Estimated count:** ~6.41 million
- **Share of total housing stock:** ~23.7%
- Most common house type in many suburban and rural regions
- Especially prevalent in post-war developments

**Key insight:**  
Semi-detached homes are often the **dominant house type outside dense urban centres**.

---

### 3. Detached Houses
- **Estimated count:** ~4.33 million
- **Share of total housing stock:** ~16%
- More common in rural and affluent suburban areas
- Higher average floor area and plot size

**Key insight:**  
Detached houses form a significant minority but are far less common than terraced or semi-detached homes.

---

### 4. Bungalows
- **Estimated count:** ~2.48 million
- **Share of total housing stock:** ~9–10%
- Predominantly single-storey
- Strong association with older occupants

**Key insight:**  
Bungalows represent a **small but distinct segment** of single-residency housing.

---

## Contextual (Non-House) Property Types

These are **not single-residency houses**, but are included for completeness:

- **Flats / Maisonettes:** ~6.4 million (~23.6%)
- **Caravans / Mobile homes / Annexes:** <1%

| Property Type          | Estimated Count | Approx. Share |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Terraced Houses       | ~7.02 million   | ~25.9%        |

| Other                 | ~0.18 million   | <1%           |

---

## Key Aggregate Insights

- **Terraced + Semi-Detached houses ≈ 50% of all UK dwellings**
- **All single-residency houses combined ≈ 75% of total housing stock**
- Flats dominate dense urban areas but do not represent single-residency housing
- UK housing stock is heavily influenced by:
  - Pre-1919 terraces
  - Inter-war and post-war semi-detached developments

---

## Notes on Data Sources

- Council Tax Stock of Properties (UK Government)
- Office for National Statistics (ONS) Census data
- Scottish House Condition Survey (contextual comparison)

> Proprietary datasets such as **CACI** and **LBSD** typically align closely with these distributions, with enhanced granularity by region, age, and socio-economic segmentation.

---

## Intended Use

This dataset is suitable for:
- Housing stock modelling
- Energy / heat-loss archetyping
- Urban planning and retrofit analysis
- Market segmentation and housing typology studies

# 4. Relevance to Energy & Heat-Loss Modelling

### UK-Wide
- Semi-detached and terraced houses dominate retrofit potential
- High variability in exposed area and fabric condition

### London (LBSM)
- High proportion of:
  - Party walls
  - Compact forms
  - Flats with minimal envelope exposure
- LBSM enables:
  - Archetype-based modelling
  - Borough-level aggregation
  - EPC-driven fabric inference

---

# 5. Notes on Data Usage

- **LBSM / LBSM2** does not publish simple national summaries
- Aggregated statistics are derived by:
  - Processing raw LBSM building records
  - Aligning with Census accommodation categories
- Percentages are rounded and indicative

---

## Summary

- The **UK housing stock** is dominated by **single-residency houses**
- **London is structurally different**, with flats forming the majority
- **Terraced houses** are the most common house type both nationally and in London
- **LBSM provides the definitive spatial and energy framework for London**, while national datasets remain necessary for UK-wide context
